        <font face="Arial">I'm a 22 year old graduate and I now find
            myself in my very first real job! My title is &quot;<em>Assistant
                I.T. Officer</em>&quot; of Lytham St. Annes High Technology
            College; but in reality this means I'm a sort of computer jack of
            all trades. The job itself is really cool, I get to do lots of
            different things, everything from writing the school's webpages
            and helping kids,&nbsp; to fixing hardware. It's not the best
            paid job in the world but between the people and variety of work
            I think for me it's the best job in the world. Next year I hope
            to continue my studies part time at the </font><a href="http://www.uclan.ac.uk/">

                align="right" hspace="2" vspace="2" width="401" height="225" start="fileopen"></font>

            Student's Union </font><a href="http://jumper.mcc.ac.uk/~ianb/compsoc/">
            <font face="Arial">Computer
                Society (aka CompSoc!)</font>
        </a>
        <font face="Arial">. One of the
            groovy things CompSoc does is maintain Nexus, which is a campus
            wide BBS running over Novell NetWare. (checkout this cool
            animated GIF..........) </font>
    </p>

    <p>
        <font face="Arial">Currently I'm working on the Windows client
            software for the new version of the BBS which runs across the
            internet. If you have a Java enabled web browser you can check
            out the Java client by clicking </font><a href="http://jumper.mcc.ac.uk/~ianb/bbs/">

        <font face="Arial">. </font>
    </p>

    <p>
        <font face="Arial">The software was written by my friend and
            housemate Ian Beckwith for his final year project. It consists of
            a C++ server running on some web enabled POSIX server and various
            clients accessing it over the internet from different platforms.
            Considering the &quot;newness&quot; of Java at the time I'm
            amazed he managed to finish it in time without selling his soul
            to some super underworld power.</font>
    </p>

    <p>
        <font face="Arial">I also play bass in an almost all girl band
            known as </font><a href="violet">
            <font face="Arial">Violet</font>
        </a>
        <font face="Arial">. I'm told sound we like a mixture of the pixies and
            fuzzbox, which is I guess kinda cool. We've always on the look
            out for places to play ,although it'll have to be in the holidays
            since most of us are at uni in radically different parts of the
            country.</font>

        <font face="Arial">By the way I have a totally
            rational hate of fish. </font>

        <font face="Arial">Of course it goes without saying that if
            you want to know more about the band or want to obtain our demo
            tape (only &pound;2:50 for 6 mostly bitter and frustrated songs) then

            totally obsessed with a few which I <strong>must</strong> listen
