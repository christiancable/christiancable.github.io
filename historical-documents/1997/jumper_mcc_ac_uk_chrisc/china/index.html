<TITLE>Really by Kate Bush but covered by the ace China Drum</TITLE>


<A NAME="Wuthering Heights"></A><center><font size=5><B>Wuthering Heights</font><BR>
<font size=4>From the B side of <I>Can't Stop These Things</I></font></font><P></center>

<font size=4>
Out on the wiley, windy moors <br>
We'd roll and fall in green <br>
You had a temper, like my jealousy <br>
Too hot, too greedy <br>
How could you leave me? <br>
When I needed to possess you <br>
I hated you, I loved you too <br>
Bad dreams in the night <br>
They told me I was going to lose the fight <br>
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering <br>
Wuthering Heights.<br>
<br>
     (Chorus)<br>
<br>
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy come home<br>
I'm so cold, let me in-a-your window<br>
<br>
Oh it gets dark, it gets lonely<br>
On the other side from you<br>
I pine alot, I find the lot<br>
Falls through without you<br>
I'm coming back love, cruel Heathcliff<br>
My only one dream, my only master<br>
Too long I roam in the night<br>
I'm coming back to his side to put it right<br>
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering<br>
Wuthering Heights<br>
<br>
     (Chorus)<br>
<br>
Oh let me have it, let me grab your soul away<br>
Oh let me have it, let me grab your soul away<br>
You know it's me, Cathy<br>
<br>
     (Chorus)<br>
