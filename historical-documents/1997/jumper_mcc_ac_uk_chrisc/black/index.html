<font size=6><CENTER>What?</CENTER><font size=3>
<B><p> Blackpool is a holiday resort on the North Western coast of England about 20 miles away from Preston where I go to university.
It's mostly famous for it's large tower, a very silly number of coloured light bulbs and the tallest roller coaster in the world.
I've lived here for almost 14 years in the suburbs of South Shore (cunning name for the southern area of the town); about a mile away from the beach. Locally there is a small air port, Morrisons (which I'm often sure *is* larger than the air port), The Spar (sadly not a 24 one :-( ) and a rather interesting shop called 'Bargain Booze'. Oh, and round the corner there's also Highfield High where I used to go to school.

<b><p>
There's a few places in Blackpool that I really do like and try to visit when ever I'm not in Preston. Besides catching up with my rather strange folks, I tend to be found in <I>The Tache</I> which is Blackpool's *only* rock club. The only other half decent place to spend fuzzy night outs is <I>Jenks</I> which is a somewhat mobile indie club. (I wish it was still back in it's old building) Of course you may enjoy fuzzy afternoons too (well who doesn't every once in a while?) and *the* place to go was The Stanely Beer engine (formerly known as The Stanely Arms, The Blue Room and the Hogshead) but the past few months (and the depature of Bernard, who told the world's worst funny jokes) has given way to somewhat impressive competition from 'O'Neals' which is full of wonderful warm corners and friendly wooden tables.<br>
If you're a fan of eating out then my absolute fave place is <I><a href="http://www.eat.com/dessert-guide/">Mamma's</a></I> which is a wonderful itialian restaurant, it's about 5 minutes away from the bus station and can provide the perfect end to a lazy afternoon. (they do a carbonara to die for)
