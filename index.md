## About

Hello, my name is Christian and I make websites.

I work at the [University of Kent][kent-univeristy] as a Web Developer in the University's [Web Development Team][web-team] within [Information Services][is]. I'm excited to be spending most of my time working on [Astro](https://github.com/unikent/astro) our new, open-source, web publishing platform. 

I spent most of my 20s and 30s in a [variety of roles][linked-in] at [Lancaster University][lancaster-university] jumping between [web development][iss], [elearning][careers] and [systems administration][maths]. 

[Outside of work](play), I used to spent a lot of time [making photographs][flickr] but these days I'm mostly just found on the [instagram][instagram]. 

After spending my entire life in [_the North_](https://youtu.be/HwtSdJaPCSI) I feel a litte confused by [Canterbury](http://www.canterbury.co.uk/) and its curious lack of rain.
