## About

Hello, my name is Christian and I make websites.

I work at [Lancaster University][lancaster-university] as a <s>Web Assistant</s> er <s>Web Developer</s> _...ahem..._ _Web Marketing Officer_ in the [University Web Team][web-team] within <s>Marketing and External Linkages</s> _...ahem..._ *Communications and Marketing*.

Previously I worked in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics][maths] as a _Systems Administrator_ and then as a _Web Developer_ as part of the [Postgraduate Statistics Centre][psc] project. In the early 2000s I worked for [the Careers Service][careers] helping to bring careers guidance to the Internet. 

If you're really interested in that sort of stuff you can find out far too much information over on [Linked in][linked-in].

[Outside of work](play) I'm a keen amateur [photographer][flickr] and member of [Lancaster Photographic Society][lps].
