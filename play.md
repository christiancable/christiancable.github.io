## Pictures

I love taking photographs; selfishly keeping little moments of time forever. I have served as Programme Secretary, Vice-President and President of the [Lancaster Photographic Society][lps].

I've written and shot a [coffee table style photographic book][book] documenting the production of organic and ethical food.

You can find pictures of mine in the following places

* [Flickr][flickr]
* [Instagram][instagram]
* My [Photography Blog][photoblog]

## Internets

When I was a kid my parents thought that I spent too much time on the computer, as an adult this trend seems to have continued. Here's some of the places you can find me on the mighty internets. I can't promise these are useful or work related.
