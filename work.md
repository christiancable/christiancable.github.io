## Role

I work in the [University Web Team](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/current-staff/communications-and-marketing/web-team/) helping to make the University's websites better. 

I've worked on the web since '97 and I'm interested in making useful, fun and effective websites. 

I work with webfolk across the University but my main focus is [FASS](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/). We are currently very busy working to create new websites for their departments within the TerminalFour SiteManager CMS.
