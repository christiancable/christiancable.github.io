## Role

I work at Lancaster University where I am the _technical lead_ for the  [University Web Team](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/current-staff/communications-and-marketing/web-team/). My time is spent worrying about markup, wrangling content, wrestling with the [content management system](http://www.terminalfour.com/) and turning coffee into PHP. 

I've worked on the web since '97 and I'm interested in making useful, fun and effective websites. 

If you can stand their _crazy urls_ then you can find more about my work history on [Linked in][linked-in].
